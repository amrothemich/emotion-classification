247,I walked my dog and she still pooped inside!
248,Every time I see my husband I know I could never cheat on him. We are both flirty people but know that it will never be worth messing up what we have.
249, I was home alone the other night and I heard a loud crash in the other room. It turned out to just be the dog ran into a shelf and knocked something down but it was scary.
250,"I really love my life. This may seem crazy to some since it's fairly simple. I work online, I play games and then I read and watch tv and then I do chores."
251,I got home and all of my friends were waiting for me to have a birthday party i did not know about!
252,I recently forgot I owed a little bit of money to my mother in law for something. It ended up being ok but being reminded wasn't that pleasent.
253,I recently got to take an amazing day trip to San Antonio. There was so much to see and do.
254,I gratuated from college with the highest score in the past 20 years

263,I felt this morning I left the house and my neighbor gave me some flowers ... incredible I did not expect it
264,"My neighbor had her dog outside on the walkway between our condo units. This dog is loud and doesn't like my dogs, so we have to avoid when it's outside. I needed to walk my dogs and couldn't because it was out there."
265,"My husband received a call this morning and he became very nervous, which put me in a bad mood, "
266,"I was looking at pictures from my wedding, specifically one of a bunch of my friends and I having a drink. I got a little wistful for hanging out with friends like that."

273,My son misbehaved with his friends and I had to punish him
274,When my brother got out of college he had a job and a car and was doing so fucking great for himself. Everything was lined up and he was ready to take off in the world. The moment I graduated college I have nothing that I can do. I took the same degree but that 5 year gap has led me to have nothing compared to him. 
275,I had a job interview and went in feeling very good about it.
276,"I was digging through my old stuff yesterday, and I found my old security blanket."
277,It really bothers me seeing all the back to school shopping. Parents are more worried about appearance than education. It's about school supplies not buying Jordans.
278,I found a stray kitten and nursed him back to health.
279,Its hard to deal with when your kids are getting older and have to handle their own problems. As a mom you can't just step in and fix everything like you want to.

290,I was waiting to see if I was going to receive an award

292,I felt so nervous going into my latest job interview.
293,It really bothers me when people let their toddler run around the mall. None the less smelling like a litter box that hasn't been cleaned in a month.

She wasn't sure because this was literally her first day, but she didn't charge me. Later I went on their website and couldn't find any description of such a free-pizza policy and I felt terrible, wondering if the store was going to take the cost of the pizza out of this girl's paycheck."
342,when you expect more you have been disapponted more
343,when you expect more you have been disapponted more
344,"Once, I was in a college in a classroom. I was sitting there and suddenly I realized that I have worn wrong pair of socks. No one was knowing it as I have worn shoes. But, when we have to go in church we have to remove shoes. So, at that time, a friend of mine spotted me. That time, that made a fun of me and I was in a little awkward situation."

I didn't even ask but was very appreciative of his help."
368,"I knew someone who got exceedingly famous. It sort of eats me up how successful and popular they are. What's worse is that I don't think they're very talented, and a lot of their success is due to a phony persona they maintain. It really bothers me."
